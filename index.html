    <h2 id="interest">Interests</h2>
    <p>I have always had a broad interest in software and how to build good one. This includes all but not excludively the followings:
      <ul>
          <li>Software development methodology (i.e. Agile, TDD/BDD, DDD...)</li>
          <li>Architecture</li>
          <li>Design Patterns</li>
          <li>Infrastructure</li>
          <li>Security</li>
          <li>CI/CD</li>
          <li>Testing</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I'm a big believer in clean design. To me, anything that is clean is easier to work with, to maintain and extend and overall make the software development faster and less error proned.
